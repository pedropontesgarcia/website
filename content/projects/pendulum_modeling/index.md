> *How can the behaviour of a pendulum be modelled mathematically?*

This was the title of my IB extended essay, a 42-page paper exploring different mathematical and computational models to describe the behaviour of a pendulum.

My supervisor Paulina Szymczak-Ã˜nnerstad deserves a special mention here due to her patience, her advice and her thorough feedback on the drafts.
