## The Zephyr engine

We are proud to present the Zephyr Game Engine, an easy-to-use game development framework for OCaml. Harnessing the power of the popular SDL2 graphics library and the beauty of OCaml programming, Zephyr makes it easy to design custom levels with different obstacles, taking advantage of features such as animated sprites, advanced collision physics, tilemaps, and optimized texture loading.

## Concrete Halls: A game on Zephyr

As a demonstration of the power of Zephyr, we are also presenting Concrete Halls, a cyberpunk 2D side-scrolling game based on a thrilling storyline. Concrete Halls takes advantage of the ease of level creation provided by the Zephyr engine and includes a total of 15 custom platforming levels, as well as a cutscene after the main menu. Concrete Halls serves to demonstrate that Zephyr's custom types and functions are extremely easy to work with in order to produce a custom 2D game.
