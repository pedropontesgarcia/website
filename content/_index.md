I'm Pedro, a student and researcher at Cornell University. I'm completing a bachelor's in Computer Science and Mathematics, and I'm currently part of the [Calyx project](https://calyxir.org/) in the [Capra lab](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/). Academics aside, I enjoy skiing, canoeing, photography, and philosophical reading.
